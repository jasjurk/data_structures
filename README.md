# data_structures
This is a repository of implementations of some data structures done in my spare time, mostly for programming competitions. They are rarely ready to use as a general purpose structure, but can be easily refactored into complience with stl guidelines. I decided to share those codes to possibly help to understand some implementations of possibly nontrivial data structures.
